# Melbourne Housing Regression

This project uses housing data from Domain.com.au posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market), the project is focused on doing analysis on the data, as well as creating multiple models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict the price of a home in Melbourne, Australia. This is done to gain a better insight into housing prices as well as gain a market advantage though the potential use of the targeted advertising with the help of the modelling.
